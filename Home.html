    <p>AI is becoming bigger nowadays and I am excited to share an opportunity that has the potential to create a significant impact in our community. With the growing demand for technological solutions and the need for increased digital technology, there is a gap that we can address and help those people who need it. By gaining expertise and learning from the resources available at Holberton, I can organize my own workshop where I can teach programs aimed at introducing coding and technology to people who do not know about technology. By giving individuals the essential programming skills and empowering them to embrace technology, we can bridge the digital divide and create innovation within our community. Through this initiative, we have the potential to transform lives, open doors to new opportunities, and empower individuals to shape their futures. Together, let's make a lasting impact by empowering our community through technology and education.</p>

During my time in college, I developed this website as a platform to share my passion for the sport and my vision for a future business. The website features the idea of how we can make a pitcher using AI. This website Contained Prices, programs, Sets, eventually would be getting more and more adjustment since I will be learning in Holberton about it. 

        Building upon this initial venture, my long-term goal is to develop an AI-powered program that can analyze the amounts of data collected from pitchers. By combining artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, this program aims to provide valuable insights and recommendations for improving pitching techniques and increasing overall efficiency on the baseball field. 
        
        Through advanced data analysis, the AI program will identify patterns, detect areas for improvement, and generate personalized training strategies for pitchers. The goal is to help players enhance their performance, prevent injuries, and optimize their pitching mechanics based on the data-driven suggestions provided by the AI system. 
        
        By combining the expertise of baseball mechanics with the power of AI, this venture will help to revolutionize the way pitchers train and improve their skills here In PR. The ultimate objective is to create a comprehensive ecosystem that empowers players, coaches, and teams to achieve their full potential in the realm of baseball.
